#Graphing cheat sheets

Posit, the company that marks Rstudio has created some really fantastic resources to help leverage the most out of ggplot2. Access cheatsheet documents for ggplot2. They are available [here](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html).

In particular I recommend looking at the PDF available on this website. [PDF link](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).
