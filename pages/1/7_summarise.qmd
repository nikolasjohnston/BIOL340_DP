```{r knitr options, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
weeds<-read.csv("../../resources/datafiles/weeds.csv")
library(tidyverse)
weeds <- rename(weeds, flowers = flowers.m3)
frogsp<-read.csv("../../resources/datafiles/frogs.csv", header=TRUE)
enviro<-read.csv("../../resources/datafiles/frog_environmental.csv", header=TRUE)
```

This is an extremely useful function that lets you create different summaries of columns. You can also nest other functions within it to apply them to your columns.

```{r}
sum_data <- summarise(weeds, mean(flowers))  # We'll start simple. Generates the mean of the flower column

sum_data <- summarise(group_by(weeds, species), mean(flowers)) 
# Using the group_by() function within summarise lets you get summaries for groups, in this case "species"

sum_data <- summarise(group_by(weeds,species, soil), mean(flowers), sd(flowers), se=sd(flowers/sqrt(n())))
# Grouped by with species & soil, generating mean, standard deviation & standard error of flowers

```

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
median <- summarise(group_by(insect, fragment), median(species.richness))
```

The last example generates the mean, sd and se for each factor combination in our dataset. This is pretty useful, particularly for generating bar graphs.

However, its a little complex and can be in a much nicer format.
