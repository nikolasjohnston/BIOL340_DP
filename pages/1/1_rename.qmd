You will often need to rename data you enter or obtain from others, as R converts any spaces to fullstops and people tend to capitilise most words. The `rename()` function allows us to simply rename a column name within our data frame.

\
Personally, this is my favourite function in R as I hate captials, fullstops and other annoying column name problems that slow down coding or generate errors. Trust me, when you spend an hour trying to fix a line of code only to find a single capital letter is missing, you will understand.

To do this with dplyr (a tidyverse package) we simply use the following command:

```{r}
weeds <- rename(weeds, flowers = flowers.m3)
# In the brackets we need to specify our data frame (weeds) followed by a second argument specifying the name we want for our column = the name we already have.
# Again, if you run this by itself it will not save to your data frame, unless you direct it to your data frame variable using the <- 
```

Pretty simple and straightforward.

If you want to rename multiple columns, this is a pretty simple addition. For demonstrating purposes, I am going to rename all the columns of weeds to nonsensical crap.

```{r}
grocerylist <- rename(weeds, coopers = "flowers", asahi = "species", vb = "soil", littlecreatures = "weeds")
# to specify multiple variables/columns, we simply add a comma after the first rename and keep going. 
```

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Alternatively, you can specify the variables to change separately in a line before the `rename()` command.  
beer <- c(coopers = "flowers", asahi = "species", vb = "soil", littlecreatures = "weeds")
grocerylist <- rename(weeds, !!beer)
```
