The first step when opening a new R studio environment or project is creating a script or notebook for working in. Scripts are basic text files where all code is executable. Writing non-code in a script requires the use of \#'s (which can look messy and confusing) like so:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
read.csv("datafile.csv") 
# this code reads a csv (data) file into R. The command read.csv requires brackets with the filepath to the file in quotations. 
# in this code, none of the #'s will run. so if I # the read.csv command, it will not run. like so:
# read.csv("datafile.csv")
```

A whole document of the above example can get messy and hard to understand.

In a notebook, we separate normal text from code by inserting "code chunks" (*insert \> R* in the top right of the window). Chunks are specialised areas in the notebook for code only. Chunks separate code from text, making it easier to write notes and read. *These tutorials have been written in a notebook*.

-   To create a notebook or script, simply use the pulldown menus *file \> new file* and select either a script, markdown or notebook one. Then save the document by hitting the disk icon (or *file \> save*)
    -   R studio will prompt you to install some packages to use a notebook. Do so and then read the text in the notebook. Once you understand, then clear everything below the "output:" --- area.
-   As stated above, click the **insert** pulldown menu in the script window and click **R** to insert a code chunk. All code in a notebook must be written in a chunk

#### IMPORTANT!

-   When working in a project, wherever you save your project will become the default "directory". R will look here for files first. If you want to set your working directory elsewhere, use the below code.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE}

# Only if you have not created a project

setwd("Drive:/Folder1/Folder2")

# insert your folders path in the brackets
# this will tell R to look here for files and "generally" save things here as well.
# e.g. C:/Users/Mitch/Documents/R/
```

::: callout
After writing your code, you can click *run*, *run selected line(s)*, *run current chunk* or press *Ctrl* + *Enter* on the line your cursor is on

**Get used to this, you will do this A LOT**
