You can also nest other functions within it to apply them to your columns.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum_data <- summarise(weeds, mean(flowers))  # We'll start simple. Generates the mean of the flower column\n\nsum_data <- summarise(group_by(weeds, species), mean(flowers)) \n# Using the group_by() function within summarise lets you get summaries for groups, in this case \"species\"\n\nsum_data <- summarise(group_by(weeds,species, soil), mean(flowers), sd(flowers), se=sd(flowers/sqrt(n())))\n# Grouped by with species & soil, generating mean, standard deviation & standard error of flowers\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last example generates the mean, sd and se for each factor combination in our dataset. This is pretty useful, particularly for generating bar graphs.\n\nHowever, its a little complex and can be in a much nicer format.\n",
