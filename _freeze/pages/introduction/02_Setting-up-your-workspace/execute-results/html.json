As biology and data science are becoming increasingly complex many are turning to computer intensive, coding based software (like **you!**). With this movement in data science and open access, having our code reproducible, transparent and understandable is key. So why not start off like that.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe first part of this tutorial follows many practices outlined in the fantastic [\"Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution\"](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf) from the British Ecological Society. I strongly recommend reading this at some stage.\n:::\n\n## File system\n\nBefore we jump into R, we are going to create a clean and managable folder system.\n\n::: callout\nCreate a new folder in a location of your choosing (e.g. My Documents or Desktop) called **R-tutorials**\\\n:::\n\nThis can be named anything you like, but try to keep it relevant and understandable (for future you).\n\n::: callout\nIn this new folder, create a series of new folders called:\\\n- **data**\\\n- **doc**\\\n- **figs**\\\n- **output**\\\n- **R**\n:::\n\nHere is the basic outline for these folders:\\\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The **data** folder if where you store your raw/input data</li>\n\n<li>The **doc** folder is where you store the manuscript for the project</li>\n\n<li>The **figs** folder is where all of your figures will be stored from the analyses</li>\n\n<li>The **output** folder is where you keep any intermediate datasets generated by your analysis, result reports etc.</li>\n\n<li>The **R** folder is pretty self-explanatory but it is where we will store all of our R scripts, notebooks etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nNow, let's move on to the next step. ::::\n",
