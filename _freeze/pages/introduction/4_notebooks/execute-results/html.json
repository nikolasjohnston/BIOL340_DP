Scripts are basic text files where all code is executable. Writing non-code in a script requires the use of \\#'s (which can look messy and confusing) like so:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread.csv(\"datafile.csv\") \n# this code reads a csv (data) file into R. The command read.csv requires brackets with the filepath to the file in quotations. \n# in this code, none of the #'s will run. so if I # the read.csv command, it will not run. like so:\n# read.csv(\"datafile.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA whole document of the above example can get messy and hard to understand.\n\nIn a notebook, we separate normal text from code by inserting \"code chunks\" (*insert \\> R* in the top right of the window). Chunks are specialised areas in the notebook for code only. Chunks separate code from text, making it easier to write notes and read. *These tutorials have been written in a notebook*.\n\n::: callout\n-   To create a notebook or script, simply use the pulldown menus *file \\> new file* and select either a script, markdown or notebook one. Then save the document by hitting the disk icon (or *file \\> save*)\n    -   R studio will prompt you to install some packages to use a notebook. Do so and then read the text in the notebook. Once you understand, then clear everything below the \"output:\" --- area.\n-   As stated above, click the **insert** pulldown menu in the script window and click **R** to insert a code chunk. All code in a notebook must be written in a chunk\n:::\n\n#### IMPORTANT!\n\n-   When working in a project, wherever you save your project will become the default \"directory\". R will look here for files first. If you want to set your working directory elsewhere, use the below code.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Only if you have not created a project\n\nsetwd(\"Drive:/Folder1/Folder2\")\n\n# insert your folders path in the brackets\n# this will tell R to look here for files and \"generally\" save things here as well.\n# e.g. C:/Users/Mitch/Documents/R/\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout\nAfter writing your code, you can click *run*, *run selected line(s)*, *run current chunk* or press *Ctrl* + *Enter* on the line your cursor is on\n:::\n\n**Get used to this, you will do this A LOT**\n",
