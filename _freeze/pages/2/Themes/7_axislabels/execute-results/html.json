To fix this is simple, but clumsy in how its executed. The following code uses the `expression()` argument to solve these issues.  \nI have written a x-axis label that does not make sense, in an effort to display the most common issues. These are a few of my own, so they do not make any sense with the given graph. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris.scatter <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, colour=Species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = expression(Sepal~Length[cm]), y = expression(Petal~Length^cm))+\n  labs(title = expression(Sepal~by~Petal~at~\"20\"*degree*C))\niris.scatter\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](7_axislabels_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis example, while nonsensical, demonstrates some of the major quirks with the `expression()` argument/command.  \nAcross all of the expression arguments, we specify a space between characters/words by using a tilde **~**. In our x axis, we specify a subscript (lower) by using square brackets **[]**. Anything inside these will be placed below the preceeding character. Similarly, we specify superscript by using the caret **^** to denote power. Anything placed after will be placed above the preceeding character.  \n\nIn the title line, (note that I had to place the title on a separate line...ggplot is precious sometimes) we see quotations around the 20. This is because expression does not appreciate anything starting with a number. The next thing is the use of both \"degree\" and the asterix __*__. The asterix is used when we need to write something like \"degree\" or \"pi\" to specify a symbol, but when we want it to be next to something, like a C for degree*C.  \n\nI hope this helps understand the clumsy execution of complex axis labels. \n",
